# Football-o-Genetics
Football-o-Genetics is an application for "evolving" near-optimal offensive play calling strategies. The application incorporates ideas from both artificial intelligence (specifically, genetic algorithms) and advanced statistics (in the form of a Markov model of an offensive drive) to accomplish this end. More information can be found on the [application's webpage](https://sites.google.com/view/michaelaalcorn/projectscode/football-o-genetics).
